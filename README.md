data class HistoryState(
    val highlights: List<HighlightItem>,
    val isSearching: Boolean,
    val searchQuery: String,
    // ... other state properties
)

// ViewModel (Business Logic)
class HistoryViewModel : ViewModel() {
    private val _state = MutableStateFlow(HistoryState())
    val state = _state.asStateFlow()
    
    fun onSearchToggled() { /* Implementation */ }
    // ... other business logic
}

// Composable (UI)
@Composable
fun HistoryScreen(viewModel: HistoryViewModel) {
    val state by viewModel.state.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    // UI composition based on state
}
```

### **Component Architecture**
- **Atomic Design** approach with reusable components
- **Composition over inheritance** for UI flexibility
- **Single responsibility** principle for each component
- **Props-driven** components for predictable behavior
